	abstract     = {In learning during the current epidemic, students cannot meet face to face on campus, and learning geometry in universities is a dreadful lesson before the pandemic. Both at UPGRIS and other private universities so far, students are required to use a compass and ruler in making flat shapes and building spaces so they have to face to face with the lecturer, but now it can't because it is still online, so it is necessary to make learning media that aims to help students sketch flat shapes and build spaces virtually with practice making it online with a van hiele theory approach, so the resulting product is truly capable of teaching. The result of this study is a virtual geometry lab application with van Hiele theory that is valid according to material and media experts with an average score of 93 and can be used in classrooms. At PGRI University Semarang, 96\% of students agreed that virtual media improved students' spatial ability.

	abstract     = {Introduction The extensive resources needed to train surgeons and maintain skill levels in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) are limited and confined to urban settings. Surgical education of remote/rural doctors is, therefore, paramount. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to disseminate surgical knowledge and skill development at low costs. This study presents the outcomes of the first VR-enhanced surgical training course, ‘Global Virtual Reality in Medicine and Surgery’, developed through UK-Ugandan collaborations. Methods A mixed-method approach (survey and semistructured interviews) evaluated the clinical impact and barriers of VR-enhanced training. Course content focused on essential skills relevant to Uganda (general surgery, obstetrics, trauma); delivered through: (1) hands-on cadaveric training in Brighton (scholarships for LMIC doctors) filmed in 360°; (2) virtual training in Kampala (live-stream via low-cost headsets combined with smartphones) and (3) remote virtual training (live-stream via smartphone/laptop/headset). Results High numbers of scholarship applicants (n=130); registrants (Kampala n=80; remote n=1680); and attendees (Kampala n=79; remote n=556, 25 countries), demonstrates widespread appetite for VR-enhanced surgical education. Qualitative analysis identified three key themes: clinical education and skill development limitations in East Africa; the potential of VR to address some of these via 360° visualisation enabling a ‘knowing as seeing’ mechanism; unresolved challenges regarding accessibility and acceptability. Conclusion Outcomes from our first global VR-enhanced essential surgical training course demonstrating dissemination of surgical skills resources in an LMIC context where such opportunities are scarce. The benefits identified included environmental improvements, cross-cultural knowledge sharing, scalability and connectivity. Our process of programme design demonstrates that collaboration across high-income and LMICs is vital to provide locally relevant training. Our data add to growing evidence of extended reality technologies transforming surgery, although several barriers remain. We have successfully demonstrated that VR can be used to upscale postgraduate surgical education, affirming its potential in healthcare capacity building throughout Africa, Europe and beyond.},

	abstract     = {Deaths due to heart diseases are a leading cause of death in Mexico. Cardiovascular diseases are considered a public health problem because they produce cardiorespiratory arrests. During an arrest, cardiac and/or respiratory activity stops. A cardiorespiratory arrest is rapidly fatal without a quick and efficient intervention. As a response to this problem, the VirtualCPR system was designed in the present work. VirtualCPR is a mobile virtual reality application to support learning and practicing of basic techniques of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for experts or non-experts in CPR. VirtualCPR implements an interactive virtual scenario with the user, which is visible by means of employment of virtual reality lenses. User’s interactions, with our proposal, are by a portable force sensor for integration with training mannequins, whose development is based on an application for the Android platform. Furthermore, this proposal integrates medical knowledge in first aid, related to the basic CPR for adults using only the hands, as well as technological knowledge, related to development of simulations on a mobile virtual reality platform by three main processes: (i) force measurement and conversion, (ii) data transmission and (iii) simulation of a virtual scenario. An experiment by means of a multifactorial analysis of variance was designed considering four factors for a CPR session: (i) previous training in CPR, (ii) frequency of compressions, (iii) presence of auditory suggestions and (iv) presence of color indicator. Our findings point out that the more previous training in CPR a user of the VirtualCPR system has, the greater the percentage of correct compressions obtained from a virtual CPR session. Setting the rate to 100 or 150 compressions per minute, turning on or off the auditory suggestions and turning the color indicator on or off during the session have no significant effect on the results obtained by the user.},

	abstract     = {The objective of this study was to assess the level of agreement between muscle involvement in the upper limbs of table tennis players during training in virtual reality (VR) versus a normal training environment. The research was conducted on an intentionally selected sample of 8 female probands who actively compete in a table tennis league. We monitored the activity of four selected upper limb muscles (biceps brachii, extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, and posterior deltoid) during two basic strokes (backhand and forehand topspin). The study assesses the overall muscle activation in two different environments: a regular training environment and VR. To obtain data during two basic strokes (backhand and forehand topspin), we utilized a device (Noraxon) that measures and evaluates muscle activation using surface electromyography posterior. For the VR training environment, we employed the Eleven Table Tennis program with the head-mounted display HTC Vive Pro Eye. On the other hand, the regular training environment involved the use of a Joola Table Tennis Buddy Pro robotic ball feeder. The results showed that the total muscle activation of the selected muscles varied significantly between the two environments (regular training versus VR). Specifically, for selected muscles there was a notably higher muscle load when playing in the regular environment compared to VR. Based on these findings, we recommend using the virtual environment for training only for beginners or for casual table tennis playing. For performance-level players, VR is not a suitable training tool in terms of muscle activation.},

	abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) sketching has many advantages for product design and tends to be more and more used among designers and non-designers (end-users). Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the skills needed to use VR sketching for non-designers especially VR novices in VR software. This study focuses on identifying the cognitive impact of VR sketching compared to traditional sketching on VR expert and VR novice in an experimental setting. Thirty-one participants composed of VR experts (N = 15) and VR novices (N = 16) completed a mental rotation test and then performed one traditional paper and pencil sketching task and two VR sketching tasks. We also measured the participants’ movements when using the VR sketching. Results show that VR experts perform better than VR novices in VR sketching because training is an essential element for the quality of traditional and VR sketching. Nevertheless, VR novices with previous training in traditional drawing and/or high mental rotation skills will be able to produce good-quality sketches. In addition, the results show that users moving more in the immersive environment performed better quality sketches if the drawing requires more complex shapes. Our results suggest that VR sketching can be complex to use for a part of the population that may be end-users, especially for those with little experience in traditional and VR sketching and with poor visuospatial abilities. We, therefore, advise to check the non-designers’ prior skills, otherwise, it will be necessary to train these users in VR sketching.},

This task entails the placement of virtual objects onto real-world counterparts. Our investigation focuses on discerning the distinctive features of each headset and their respective advantages within a semantic mapping context. The experiment employs a user interface enabling the creation, manipulation, and labeling of virtual 3D holograms. To ensure parity between the headsets, the VR headset mimics AR by relaying its camera feed to the user. A comprehensive user study, encompassing 12 participants tasked with mapping six tabletop objects, compares interface usability and performance between the headsets. The study participants’ evaluations highlight that the VR headset offers enhanced user-friendliness and responsiveness compared to the AR headset. Nonetheless, the AR headset excels in augmenting environmental perception and interpretation, surpassing VR in this aspect. Consequently, the study underscores that current handheld motion controllers for interacting with virtual environments outperform existing hand gesture interfaces. Furthermore, it suggests potential improvements for VR devices, including an upgraded camera feed integration. Significantly, this experiment unveils the feasibility of leveraging VR headsets for AR applications without compromising user experience. However, it also points to the necessity of future research addressing prolonged usage scenarios for both types of headsets in various interactive tasks.},

Scores {\textgreater} 90 on individual exercises and the post-test were required for successful completion. The Intuitive learning platform provided automated performance metrics and tracked trainee progression. The curriculum was implemented and data collected over a 12-month period. 21 trainees completed the entire curriculum. Post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores and trainees reported improvement in their robotic skills after curriculum completion. A comparison based on training level revealed that junior residents had significantly lower number of attempts per exercise, fewer penalties, and higher completion scores when compared to senior residents and fellows. Individual exercise analysis demonstrated that exercises, such as ‘Three-Arm Relay’ and ‘Ring Rollercoaster’, required the longest time and most attempts to achieve a passing score. The ‘Energy Pedals’ and ‘Knot Tying’ skills were the least-utilized skills addressed in the curriculum. Virtual reality-based curriculums using the Intuitive Learning platform can be standardized across multiple specialties allowing for the development of basic robotic skills, shared interdisciplinary surgical education, and provides powerful objective and automated performance metrics of trainees.},

	abstract     = {Background Virtual reality (VR) simulation is a potential solution to the barriers surgical trainees are facing. There needs to be validation for its implementation within current training. We aimed to compare VR simulation to traditional methods in acquiring surgical skills for a TFN-ADVANCED™ Proximal Femoral Nailing System (TFNA; DePuy Synthes, Auckland, New Zealand) femoral nailing system. Methods Thirty-one surgical trainees were randomised to two groups: traditional-training group (control group) and a VR-training group (intervention group) for insertion of a short cephalomedullary TFNA nail. Both groups then inserted the same TFNA system into saw-bone femurs. Surveys evaluated validity of the relevant activities, perception of simulation, confidence, stress and anxiety. The primary outcomes were tip-apex distance (TAD) and user anxiety/confidence levels. Secondary outcomes included number of screw- and nail-guidewire insertion attempts, the time taken to complete and user validity of the VR system. Results There was no statistical difference in TAD between the intervention and control groups (9mm vs 15mm, p=0.0734). The only TAD at risk of cut-out was in the control group (25mm). There was no statistical difference in time taken (2547.5ss vs 2395ss, p=0.668), nail guide-wire attempts (two for both groups, p=0.355) and screw guide-wire attempts (one for both groups, p=0.702). The control group versus intervention had higher anxiety levels (50\% vs 33\%) and had lower confidence (61\% vs 84\%). Interpretation There was no objective difference in performance on a saw-bone model between groups. However, this VR simulator resulted in more confidence and lower anxiety levels whilst performing a simulated TFNA. Whilst further studies with larger sample sizes and exploration of transfer validity to the operating theatre are required, this study does indicate potential benefits of VR within surgical training.},

The present paper is part of a broader scheme in investigating potential differentiations in interpersonal communication between the physical world and VR. Our experimental design builds upon the existing knowledge base of forced compliance experiments; the set-up involved a comparative study of two groups (N = 46) performing tasks under the authoritative influence of a researcher who applied persuasion techniques. Results indicate that VR-mediated communication is as intricate as face to face, since subjects were equally or more compliant, with the nature of information exchanged (e.g. fact-based, morality-based, etc.) being a contributing factor, whilst exemplifying under-development and future applications of VR collaborative environments.},

	abstract     = {Objective Lateral-access spine surgery has many benefits, but adoption has been limited by a steep learning curve. Virtual reality (VR) is gaining popularity and lends itself as a useful tool in enhancing neurosurgical resident education. We thus sought to assess whether VR-based simulation could enhance the training of neurosurgery residents in lateral spine surgery. Methods Neurosurgery residents completed a VR-based lateral spine module on lateral patient positioning and performing lateral lumbar interbody fusion using the PrecisionOS VR system on the Meta Quest 2 headset. Simulation occurred 1×/week every other week for a total of 3 simulations over 6 weeks. Pre- and postintervention surveys as well as intrasimulation performance metrics were assessed over time. Results The majority of resident participants showed improvement in performance scores, including an automated PrecisionOS precision score, number of radiographs used within the simulation, and time to completion. All participants showed improvement in comfort with anatomic landmarks for lateral access surgery, confidence performing lateral surgery without direct supervision, and assessing fluoroscopy in spine surgery for hardware placement and image interpretation. Participant perception on the utility of VR as an educational tool also improved. Conclusions VR-based simulation enhanced neurosurgical residents’ ability to understand lateral access surgery. Immersive surgical simulation resulted in improved resident confidence with surgical technique and workflow, perceived improvement in anatomical knowledge, and simulation performance scores. Trainee perceptions on virtual simulation and training as a curriculum supplement also improved following completion of VR training.},

They are interactive, head-referenced computer displays that give users the illusion of displacement to another location. Different terms have been applied to the illusion. Some, like the oxymoronic "artificial reality" and "virtual reality", suggest much higher performance than current technology can generally provide. Others, like "cyberspace" are puzzling neologisms. Expressions like "virtual worlds" and "virtual environment" seem preferable because they are linguistically conservative, relating to well-established terms like virtual image. In fact, we can define virtual environments as interactive, virtual image displays enhanced by special processing and by nonvisual display modalities, such as auditory and haptic, to convince users that they are immersed in a synthetic space. Why are these displays useful? Who uses them? How are they developed? The article addresses these and other questions related to this emerging technology.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The use of VR-based tangible safety education is increasing. Thus, the effectiveness of VR stability education should be verified. This study was conducted for three months by selecting infants aged 4\&ndash;5 years and their homeroom teachers enrolled in early childhood education institutions. After completing daily safety education using VR, questionnaires prepared by the teacher, comprising interviews and Q\&amp;A with the infants, were analyzed. Descriptive statistics, F-test, ANOVA, and multiple regression were used for data analysis. It was found that (a) the preference for audiovisual and VR as effective teaching methods in early childhood educational institutions was high; (b) safety education using VR showed a positive correlation with children\&rsquo;s traffic safety perceptions and attitudes; and (c) immersion was found to be a significant factor influencing the perception and attitude of safety education. These findings suggest that various methods to implement and utilize safety education programs using VR should be explored. Finally, VR safety education improved preventive attitudes toward the safety of children.},

	abstract     = {Religious diversity education has become increasingly prominent in the last few years. As the region with the second-highest religious diversity globally, Chinese Taiwan provides its students religious education early on, thus minimising misunderstandings and discrimination on the basis of religion. To diversify teaching methods, educators have adopted interactive technology as one of the primary teaching aids. This study aims to develop and evaluate the impact of an interactive technology, augmented reality (AR) in the provision of religious education. A series of experiments were conducted during the 2020 Taipei Lantern Festival of Religious Education Exhibition to explore whether using the interactive technology system significantly improved learning outcomes in comparison to traditional learning methods. To this end, a total of 50 elementary students across two experimental (n = 24) and control (n = 26) groups were recruited to participate in the study. A mixed-methods approach was used to analyse students’ subjective and objective learning outcomes. The results of the study showed that the experimental group performed significantly better in both subjective and objective learning outcomes. The findings obtained from the open-ended questions showed interactive AR technology system use positively affected the learning process. In conclusion, this study proposes that combining religious diversity education with interactive AR technology has the potential to improve students’ motivation, engage their interest, improve learning outcomes, and contribute to an increased awareness of religious diversity. It may also be helpful in limiting students’ cognitive overload during the learning process.},

One route is based on the thoughtful consideration of arguments central to the issue, whereas the other is based on the affective associations or simple inferences tied to peripheral cues in the persuasion context. This chapter discusses a wide variety of variables that proved instrumental in affecting the elaboration likelihood, and thus the route to persuasion. One of the basic postulates of the Elaboration Likelihood Model—that variables may affect persuasion by increasing or decreasing scrutiny of message arguments—has been highly useful in accounting for the effects of a seemingly diverse list of variables. The reviewers of the attitude change literature have been disappointed with the many conflicting effects observed, even for ostensibly simple variables. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) attempts to place these many conflicting results and theories under one conceptual umbrella by specifying the major processes underlying persuasion and indicating the way many of the traditionally studied variables and theories relate to these basic processes. The ELM may prove useful in providing a guiding set of postulates from which to interpret previous work and in suggesting new hypotheses to be explored in future research.},
